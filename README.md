Allegro

A single page app dedicated to helping people discover classical music. I created this because I am a classically
trained cellist and love experiencing the music as a live audience member as much as performing it on the cello. Users 
can create an account, sign in, find local classical music concerts in NYC, and save them to a "favorites" list.
